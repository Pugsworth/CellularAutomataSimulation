# CellularAutomataSimulation
This is a Typescript Nodejs program to execute various Cellular Automaton algorithms.


The goal of this repository is to not only be my impementation of various Cellular Automaton algorithms, but also to be a place where I can experiment with various design patterns and technologies.
Eventually, I would like to have a web interface that allows the user to select a Cellular Automaton algorithm  and properties and then see the results of that algorithm.
This is inspired by my small computer project (private for now) in which I will be converting typescript code to C/C++ and running on a microcontroller with a small OLED display.
